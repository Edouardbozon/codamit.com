title: A Practical guide to building cross-platform apps with Angular, Ionic, Capacitor, and Nx
draft: true
---

This article is part of a practical series on building cross-platform apps using **Angular**, **Ionic**, **Capacitor**, and **Nx**. In this first part, I'll guide you through setting up your workspace and running your app on the web and Android platforms.

## Step 1: Initialize the Workspace and Application

To begin, you'll create an Nx workspace, add Ionic and Capacitor configurations, and prepare your app for development.

### 1.1 Initialize the Nx Workspace

Run the following command to set up your Nx workspace with the `angular-monorepo` preset:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=angular-monorepo
```

> **Note: ðŸ“Œ** <br>
> The `angular-monorepo` preset sets up a scalable workspace with Angular. <br>
> Choose **ESBuild** (recommended for faster builds) or **Webpack** during setup, and opt out of SSR, as Ionic apps use client-side rendering.

Enter in `my-workspace` directory:

```bash
cd my-workspace
```

### 1.2 Add `@nxext/angular-ionic`

Next, install the `@nxext/angular-ionic` package, which provides generators for configuring and running Ionic apps:

```bash
npm install @nxext/ionic-angular -D
```

### 1.3 Configure Capacitor for Your App

Run the following command to add Capacitor configuration files for your app:

```bash
nx g @nxext/ionic-angular:configuration my-app
```

At this point, your workspace is ready to build and run your app.

## Step 2: Running `my-app` on the Web Platform

Running your app in a web browser is straightforward.

### 2.1 Serve the App in the Browser

Run the following command to serve your app:

```bash
nx serve my-app
```

Once the server starts, open the URL displayed in the terminal to view your app.

ðŸŒˆ **Ta-da!** Your app is now running in the browser.

## Step 3: Running `my-app` on the Android Platform

To test your app on an Android device or emulator, follow these steps:

### 3.1 Install Android Studio

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to emulate or deploy your app on Android devices.

> **Note:** ðŸ“Œ<br>
> Check the installation guide for more information: https://developer.android.com/studio/install

### 3.2 Add the Android Platform

Add the Android platform to your app by running:

```bash
nx run my-app:add:android
```

This command generates platform-specific files needed to run your app on Android.

### 3.3 Open the App in Android Studio

Use Nx to open your app directly in Android Studio:

```bash
nx run my-app:open:android
```

Android Studio will open, displaying a project view similar to this:

### 3.4 Run the App on the Emulator

1. In Android Studio, click the **Run** button (the green triangle).
2. Wait for the app to build and launch on the Android emulator.

ðŸŒŸ **Congratulations!** Your app is now running on an Android emulator.

### 3.5 Run the App on your Connected Device (optional)

1. Activate the developer mode on your device ([guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)).
2. Setup your device for development ([guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)).

### 4.0 Apply Your Changes

To reflect your modifications in Android Studio, rebuild your app:

```bash
nx build my-app
```

Sync your app's changes to the Android platform:

```bash
nx run my-app:sync:android
```

Now, rerun the app in Android Studio to see your changes applied.

> **Note:** ðŸ“Œ<br>
> To automatically rebuild the app when running the `sync` target, configure `targetDefaults` in `nx.json`.

```json
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "sync": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, youâ€™ve set up an Nx workspace, configured Angular, Ionic, and Capacitor, and successfully ran your app on the web and Android platforms. With these foundations in place, youâ€™re ready to expand your appâ€™s capabilities and target additional platforms.

Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where weâ€™ll dive deeper into building and deploying cross-platform features.
